This repository will contain the open source implementation of BLEDiff, an automated, scalable, property-agnostic, and black-box protocol noncompliance checking framework for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

BLEDiff has been accepted to IEEE S&P 2023. We will publish the open source implementation once the responsible disclosure process is complete.
