# BLEDiff

This repository will contain the open source implementation of BLEDiff, an automated, scalable, property-agnostic, and black-box protocol noncompliance checking framework for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

The corresponding paper is under review. We will publish the open source implementation once the paper is accepted and the responsible disclosure process is complete.
